                    SEASON 3 is upon us!
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Hopefully everyone is hyped about the changes and updates coming to Dragonball Fighterz. I wanted to keep everyone informed on how updates will be occuring with Framehameha! Right now I get a daily update from Google Sheets letting me know all of the changes that were updated to the sheets listed below. Once I get those updates I will be updating the site to reflect the most recent changes. Keep in mind, that this is alot of information and will take some time to settle down entirely.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>

                    I look forward to seeing everyone out on the battlefield. Let's go!

                    Hello Everyone,
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Welcome to Frame-ha-me-ha! This was a personal project that I have been working on to try and bring together multpile assets and resources. Recently <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Jonathan.Thats_Plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">That's Plus</a>(If you havent checked it out, you should.), was released by <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathan_tene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">Jonathan Tene</a> which was a huge motivator to finish this project. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Hopefully this can help fill a gap for any non android users out there. Or if you are looking to get this information on a PC/Mac without digging into the excel sheets. Speaking of those sheets this entire thing is not possible without <a href="https://twitter.com/RinSenpaiii" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">@Rin-senpaii</a> and <a href ="https://twitter.com/rafestation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">@Turtleon</a> putting in an amazing amount of work on the doc's that enabled this kind of resource. Also thank you to <a href ="https://twitter.com/CoderDBFZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" role="button">@CoderDBFZ</a> for the hitbox viewer.
